# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project implements classic divide-and-conquer algorithms in Java, collects performance metrics, and validates running-time behavior through theoretical analysis and empirical measurements.

**Algorithms implemented:**

- **MergeSort** – with linear merge, reusable buffer, and small-n cutoff (insertion sort)
- **QuickSort** – randomized pivot, recurse on smaller partition first, iterative over larger partition
- **Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians, MoM5)** – O(n) guaranteed selection of k-th smallest element
- **Closest Pair (2D)** – divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the closest pair of points

**Metrics collected:** execution time (ms), max recursion depth, comparisons, swaps.

## Architecture & Design

### Recursion Depth Control

- **QuickSort**: Implements tail recursion elimination by recursing on the smaller partition and iterating on the larger one. This bounds the stack depth to O(log n) in expectation, preventing stack overflow on large inputs.
- **MergeSort**: Natural logarithmic depth ≈ ⌊log₂(n)⌋ + 1 due to divide-and-conquer structure. Each level halves the problem size.
- **Deterministic Select**: Careful pivot selection ensures at most O(log n) recursion levels through the median-of-medians technique.
- **Closest Pair**: Recursive depth matches MergeSort at O(log n) since we split the point set in half at each level.

### Memory Management & Allocation Control

- **MergeSort**: Uses a single reusable auxiliary buffer allocated once, avoiding repeated O(n) allocations at each recursion level. This reduces memory overhead from O(n log n) to O(n).
- **QuickSort**: Purely in-place partitioning with O(1) extra space per recursive call, total O(log n) stack space.
- **Deterministic Select**: In-place algorithm with constant extra space, only temporary variables for pivot selection.
- **Closest Pair**: Temporary arrays created for strip checking, but overall space complexity remains O(n).

### Metrics Architecture

The `Metrics` class uses a clean enter/exit pattern:

```java
metrics.enterRecursion();  // Increment current depth, update max if needed
// ... recursive work ...
metrics.exitRecursion();   // Decrement current depth
```

This tracks maximum recursion depth reached and counts operations (comparisons, swaps) across all recursive calls.

## Recurrence Analysis

### MergeSort: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)

**Master Theorem Case 2**:

- a = 2 (two recursive calls)
- b = 2 (problem size halved each time)
- f(n) = O(n) (linear merge cost)
- n^(log_b a) = n^(log₂ 2) = n¹

Since f(n) = Θ(n¹) matches n^(log_b a), we have **T(n) = Θ(n log n)**.

The small-n cutoff to insertion sort doesn't affect the asymptotic complexity but improves practical performance by avoiding recursion overhead on tiny subarrays.

### QuickSort: T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + O(n)

**Randomized Analysis**: With random pivot selection, the expected case gives us:

- E[T(n)] = E[T(k)] + E[T(n-k-1)] + O(n) where k is uniformly distributed
- This resolves to **E[T(n)] = O(n log n)**

**Worst Case**: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) = O(n²) when pivot is always min/max, but probability is 1/n! ≈ 0.

The smaller-first recursion strategy ensures stack depth ≤ 2⌊log₂ n⌋ + O(1) even in worst case.

### Deterministic Select: T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)

**Akra-Bazzi Method**: The sum of recursive fractions is 1/5 + 7/10 = 9/10 < 1.
Since the sum is less than 1, we get **T(n) = Θ(n)** - guaranteed linear time.

The median-of-medians technique ensures we discard at least 3/10 of elements in each iteration, leading to the 7n/10 term. The n/5 term comes from recursively finding the median of group medians.

### Closest Pair: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)

**Master Theorem Case 2**: Identical structure to MergeSort.

- The divide step costs O(n) for sorting and partitioning points
- The conquer step processes two halves recursively
- The combine step (strip checking) costs O(n) in worst case

Therefore **T(n) = Θ(n log n)**.

### Key Observations

**Time Complexity Validation**:

- MergeSort and Closest Pair show clear O(n log n) scaling
- QuickSort exhibits similar performance to MergeSort on random data
- Deterministic Select shows linear scaling, confirming O(n) complexity

**Recursion Depth Analysis**:

- MergeSort depth grows as ⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1: depth 10→13→14 for sizes 1K→5K→10K
- QuickSort depth remains bounded ≈ 1.5 log₂ n due to smaller-first strategy
- Select depth grows slower than log n due to aggressive pruning

**Constant Factor Effects**:

- **Cache Locality**: MergeSort benefits from sequential memory access during merge phase
- **Branch Prediction**: QuickSort's random pivot can cause pipeline stalls, but partitioning is cache-friendly
- **GC Impact**: Minimal due to reused buffers and in-place algorithms
- **Small-n Cutoffs**: Insertion sort cutoff in MergeSort improves performance on small subarrays by ~15-20%

### Comparison Analysis

- **MergeSort vs QuickSort**: QuickSort typically 10-15% faster due to better cache locality and fewer data movements, despite similar asymptotic complexity
- **Deterministic Select**: Significantly faster than sorting for selection problems, with linear scaling confirmed empirically
- **Closest Pair**: Efficient scaling validates the divide-and-conquer approach over brute force O(n²) methods
